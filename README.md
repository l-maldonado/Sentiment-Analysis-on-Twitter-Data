# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data

## Overview

This project explores various methods of sentiment analysis on a dataset of Twitter posts. The objective is to compare the performance of different sentiment analysis techniques, such as lexicon-based approaches, machine learning models, and deep learning techniques. The analysis includes evaluating accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each method.

## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a crucial technique in natural language processing (NLP) used to determine the sentiment or emotional tone of a piece of text. This project focuses on analyzing Twitter data to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. Several sentiment analysis techniques are implemented and compared to identify the most effective approach for this specific dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of tweets gathered using the Twitter API. It includes information such as tweet text, user details, and timestamp. The data is preprocessed to remove irrelevant content like URLs, mentions, and hashtags, and is then used for sentiment classification tasks.

**Source**: [Insert dataset source or API used]

## Methods

### Lexicon-based Analysis

- **Overview**: This method uses predefined lists of words (positive and negative) to determine sentiment. The sentiment of a tweet is computed based on the frequency and intensity of the words that match the lexicon.
- **Tools/Techniques**: VADER, TextBlob

### Machine Learning Models

- **Overview**: Machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are trained on labeled tweet data to classify sentiments.
- **Tools/Techniques**: Scikit-learn, TF-IDF Vectorizer

### Deep Learning Models

- **Overview**: Deep learning techniques, particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are employed to capture more complex patterns in text data.
- **Tools/Techniques**: Keras, TensorFlow, LSTM, Word2Vec or GloVe embeddings

## Evaluation Metrics

The following metrics are used to evaluate and compare the sentiment analysis methods:

- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correctly predicted sentiments.
- **Precision**: Proportion of positive predictions that are actually positive.
- **Recall**: Proportion of actual positive cases that are correctly predicted.
- **F1-score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed. You will also need to install the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- tensorflow
- keras
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- vaderSentiment
- textblob

### Installation Steps

1.  Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/sentiment-analysis-twitter.git
    cd sentiment-analysis-twitter

    ```

2.  Install the required dependencies:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

3.  Download the Twitter dataset (if applicable):

    Follow the instructions in the /data folder to acquire the dataset.

## Usage

**Running the Jupyter Notebook**

To explore and run the analysis, open the Jupyter notebook sentiment_analysis.ipynb located in the /notebooks folder.

> jupyter notebook

You can run each cell in the notebook to:

1. Load and preprocess the data
2. Perform sentiment analysis using different methods
3. Visualize the results

**Running the Scripts**

To execute the individual sentiment analysis scripts, you can run the Python files in the /src folder directly:

    python src/lexicon_analysis.py
    python src/ml_model.py
    python src/dl_model.py

## Results

The results of each sentiment analysis method are compared based on the evaluation metrics. Visualizations and tables summarizing the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores for each method are provided in the Jupyter notebook.

## Conclusion

This project aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of different sentiment analysis methods applied to Twitter data. The comparison results show how traditional lexicon-based methods fare against modern machine learning and deep learning techniques, helping guide future applications of sentiment analysis in social media research.
